# Hi there, I'm Sergey 👋
## Deep Learning Engineer student

-I studied the C# programming language, worked with databases using Entity Framework, used WinForms, and dabbled a little with TelegramAPI.
-I am currently taking a course at The Founder online school on developing neural networks in Python.

That's all for now, but this file will be updated with new text over time!😇
